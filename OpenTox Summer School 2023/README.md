# Magnolia Presentation Materials for OpenTox Summer School 2023

This repository contains model source code, data sets and training materials used in the Magnolia session at OpenTox Summer School 2023.

Magnolia is an application for modeling processes whose behavior can be described by systems of differential equations, including PBPK, PK/PD and systems biology models. Magnolia provides the tools for developing models using an equation-based modeling language, scripting the execution of simulations using either the Python programming language or a simple command-based language, and for interactively exploring model behavior using an intuitive user interface. The modeling and analysis languages used by Magnolia are modernized versions of those originally implemented in ACSL and acslX, two tools which were widely used in the biological modeling community for several decades, and which provided the platform on which a large body of published PBPK models have been developed.

Two slide sets are available to provide background information on Magnolia and instruction on basic usage of the tool:

- [Intro Slides Section 1](https://github.com/magnoliasci/PBPK/blob/main/OpenTox%20Summer%20School%202023/Intro%20to%20M%26S%20Using%20Magnolia%20-%20Applications%20to%20PK%20-%20Section%201.pdf): background information on Magnnolia, summary of features, download and installation instructions.

- [Intro Slides Section 2](https://github.com/magnoliasci/PBPK/blob/main/OpenTox%20Summer%20School%202023/Intro%20to%20M%26S%20Using%20Magnolia%20-%20Applications%20to%20PK%20-%20Section%202.pdf): overview of user interface and basic modeling workflow.

Magnolia is freely available.  More information on the software can be found at https://www.magnoliasci.com.
