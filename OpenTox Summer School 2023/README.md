# Magnolia Presentation Materials for OpenTox Summer School 2023

This repository contains model source code, data sets and training materials used in the Magnolia session at OpenTox Summer School 2023.

Two slide sets are available to provide background information on Magnolia and instruction on basic usage of the tool:

- [Intro Slides Section 1](https://github.com/magnoliasci/PBPK/blob/main/OpenTox%20Summer%20School%202023/Intro%20to%20M%26S%20Using%20Magnolia%20-%20Applications%20to%20PK%20-%20Section%201.pdf)

- [Intro Slides Section 2](https://github.com/magnoliasci/PBPK/blob/main/OpenTox%20Summer%20School%202023/Intro%20to%20M%26S%20Using%20Magnolia%20-%20Applications%20to%20PK%20-%20Section%202.pdf)

Magnolia is an application for modeling systems whose behavior can be described by systems of differential equations. Magnolia provides the tools for developing models using an equation-based modeling language, scripting the execution of simulations using either the Python programming language or a simple command-based language, and for interactively exploring model behavior using an intuitive user interface.

Magnolia is freely available.  More information on the software can be found at https://www.magnoliasci.com.
