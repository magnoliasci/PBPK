Magnolia is an application for modeling systems whose behavior can be described by systems of differential equations. Magnolia provides the tools for developing models using an equation-based modeling language, scripting the execution of simulations using either the Python programming language or a simple command-based language, and for interactively exploring model behavior using an intuitive user interface.

Magnolia is freely available.  More information on the software can be found at https://www.magnoliasci.com.
