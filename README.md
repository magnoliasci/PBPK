# Magnolia PBPK Model Repository

This repository contains a variety of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models developed in Magnolia. Magnolia is an environment for modeling systems whose behavior can be described by systems of differential equations. Magnolia provides the tools for developing models using an equation-based modeling language, scripting the execution of simulations using either the Python programming language or a simple command-based language, and for interactively exploring model behavior using an intuitive user interface.

Magnolia is freely available.  More information on the software can be found at https://www.magnoliasci.com.
